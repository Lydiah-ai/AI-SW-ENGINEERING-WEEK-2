SDG and Problem
- SDG 2 (Zero Hunger): Addressing global food insecurity.
- Problem: Farmers often struggle to predict crop yields due to unpredictable weather patterns, soil conditions, and market demands. AI can help farmers make informed decisions by forecasting crop yields based on various environmental factors.
2. ML Approach
- Supervised Learning: regression models to predict crop yields.
- Why? Crop yield prediction involves numerical output, making regression a suitable choice.
- Algorithms: Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting, or Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
3. Dataset & Tools
- Datasets:
  - Kaggle’s “Global Food Security Dataset”
- Tools:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn for regression models
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning
4. Model Development
Data Preprocessing
- Remove missing values
- Normalize features (rainfall, temperature, soil quality)
5. Ethical Reflection
Bias Risks:
- Data may favor large-scale farming over smallholder farmers.
- Regional disparities (developed vs. developing nations).
- Fairness & Sustainability:
- Ensure diverse datasets representing multiple farming conditions.
- Promote equitable access to AI-driven recommendations for farmers in remote areas.
Deliverables
- Code: Python notebook with preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Report:
- SDG problem: Food security.
- ML approach: Regression for crop yield prediction.
